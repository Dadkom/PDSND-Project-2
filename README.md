# PDSND-Project-2 - Bike Share Systems
# Date Created: November, 14 2019
# Overview
This is a project that uses Python program to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Then, you will type code to import data and answer important questions by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write script that takes initial inputs to create an interactive device experience to provide these statistics.
# The Dataset:
Now selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

# The Statistics Computed:
In this project, you will write code to provide the following information for bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics:

#1 - Popular times of travel:
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

#2 - Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end

#3 - Trip duration:
* total travel time
* average travel time

#4 - User info:
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

# The Files:
You will need the three city dataset files to run the bikeshare.py file.

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

# Tools Used
 1- Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
 
 2- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
 
 3- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
